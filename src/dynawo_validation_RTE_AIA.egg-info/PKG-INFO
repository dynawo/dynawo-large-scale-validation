## Intro

This repository contains two main parts. Dynawaltz validation and Dynaflow validation. In addition, it has a set of common utilities that serve for both parts.

## How to use it

Before following this process, it is important to read the document located in commons called README_INSTALLATION.md
There are two ways to use it. The first is to add the root directory to the system's PATH and use the scripts individually. You can find the directory by running the script located in commons: dynawo_validation_find_path.

The second way is by installing the package. This package can be downloaded from the PyPi website or created manually from the repository. To do this, we just have to go to the root directory and execute the command: python3 -m build.

A folder called "dist" will be created and inside there will be a .tar.gz file that we can install with: pip install dist/file_name.tar.gz.

Once installed, several instructions for the command line will have been added to our system:
- dynawaltz_run_validation
- dynaflow_run_validation
- dynawo_validation_extract_bus
- dynawo_validation_find_path
- create_graph.py - convert_dwaltz2dwoAdwoB_all.sh
- convert_dflow2dwoAdwoB_all.sh
- xml_format_dir.sh
- create_graph.py
- xml_format_dir.sh
