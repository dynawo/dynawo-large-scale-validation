Latex source files for the extended paper
=========================================

This is an extended version of the OSMSES 2022 conference paper,
to be submitted to the IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society.

* To process the paper, you just need a recent TeX distribution (such
  as Tex Live or MacTeX) and the IEEEtran macros.  These macros are
  normally bundled with the distribution (under Debian it's in package
  texlive-publishers).

* You can use the makefile to process it in one go.

* You can pretty-print the sources to a standardized format with
  latexindent (also included in most TeX distributions). The main text
  is formatted to 80 chars.
