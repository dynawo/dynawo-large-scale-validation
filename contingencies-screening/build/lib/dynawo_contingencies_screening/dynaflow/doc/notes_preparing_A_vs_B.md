CHECKLIST: actions performed to prepare a DynaFlow + Hades BASECASE
===================================================================

Assuming we start with two prepared basecases

  1. First of all follow all the steps to prepare the cases as if they were Dynawo vs. Hades
  
  2. Run the script convert_dflow2dwoAdwoB.sh BASECASE_A BASECASE_B to generate a new directory with the files. 
  
  3. Run both cases before proceeding.
